This document holds all the information about the Usability Tests that were conducted of our ESE project (event management app) on 27th November 2019.

Testers: Patrick, Pascal

### Description of our project

Our app aims to be a platform where people who wish to employ certain services such as catering, cleaning, security, entertainment et cetera for their events come into contact with providers of said services.

We accomplish this by allowing our users to register into our app, browse the explore page where available services by other users are located, and add the ones they wish to employ to their own events. Events are private and can be created by the user. They hold certain information like name, date, location and a list of employed services. 

Additionally, if a user wants to provide their own services, they are able to do so by adding their services to their profile. The newly created service will be added to the explore page and can be browsed by other users.

As soon as a user adds a certain service to one of their events, the service provider will be notified that the user expresses interest in said service. Provider and user will subsequently be able to get into contact through our in-built messaging system where they can discuss an eventual employment of the service.

### Status of our project

With our app in its current state, it is possible to 

- sign up or login into our app
- browse available services on our explore page (these services are each provided by a user) and searching for specific ones by filtering name and tags
- view the details of each service on its own page
- view one's profile page and the profile pages of other users
- add a service to one's profile (this will display the service on the user's profile page and on the explore page where it can be searched for via name and/or tags)

## Preparation

We decided to create a fairly long test with individual steps that guide the testers through the app. We will urge the testers to give us their feedback on how intuitive the GUI is, how easily they can locate the features and if they think that certain elements are missing from the GUI to guarantee a pleasant user experience.

### Test
1. Find the menu.
2. Register a new user.
3. Visit your profile page.
4. Create a new service with up to three tags
5. Visit the explore page.
6. Search for services with the tags 'party' and 'fancy'.
7. Clear your marked tags.
8. Search for the service 'Gelateria di Berna'.
9. Visit the provider's page of 'Gelateria di Berna'.
10. Log out.

## Execution

We will give the testers a quick overview of what our app does, and then we will have them complete the test.

For each step, we will document the users' experiences with our app according to the following structure:

| **Step** | **Were the users able to complete the step without asking for help and in a reasonably short amount of time?** | **Do the users think that the GUI used to complete the task is intuitive?** | Additional feedback and ideas for improvement |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
|          |                                                              |                                                              |                                               |
