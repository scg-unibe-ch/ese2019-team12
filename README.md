# Event Management App

This README contains all the important information on our event management app project. It is a work in progress and this description will be updated accordingly as development continues and new features are implemented.

## What our project does
Our app strives to be a platform with an integrated medium of communication for event organisers on one end and event service providers on the other. It is a web-based app designed to run on any device. 

Our goal is to provide our registered users an interactive interface where they can either login as an event organiser or as a service provider. 

Event organisers will be able to announce their upcoming events and the required services that come with it, and they will be able to browse our provider database in order to find the ones best suited for the tasks at hand. The organisers can then establish contact with said providers using our integrated messaging system in order to strike a deal of employment. 

## Why the project is useful
When you are organising an event, especially a public one, you need certain services like catering, security, logistics providers and maybe even musical acts as parts of your organisation or program. Because it can be tedious to look for these services yourself via browsing the web, we have created an easy way to look for and find providers that best suit your taste and needs.

If you are an event organiser, you may set up a profile and start browsing our registered providers in order to get into contact with the ones most suitable for the tasks at hand.

On the other side, service providers such as catering services, cleaning teams and even entertainers can register as such to be considered whenever event organisers look for related services.

## How users can get started our the project
Users may start using our app by first registering on our sign up page. Their requests will then be validated and we will grant them access to our app and interface via their profile.

## Where users can get help with our project
The best way to get help is by contacting the contributors directly via GitHub.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
This is a WIP of four university  students.
